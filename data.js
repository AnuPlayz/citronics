ROBOT SPECIFICATIONS-
1.  Dimension of the Bot should not exceed 15*15*10 Centimeters L*B*H respectively.
2.  The Bot may be wired or wireless or autonomous.
3.  The Wire (for Wired Bots) should remain slack during the complete run.
4.  A MicroMouse shall not leave any part of its body behind while navigating the Maze.
5.  A MicroMouse shall not jump over, fly over, climb, scratch, cut, burn, mark, damage, or destroy the Walls of the Maze.
6.  The Power Source should be less than 12V and 36W (DC Power Supply only).
7.  However, a tolerance of 5 % is acceptable.
8.  Bring own AC to DC Converters or own Batteries of any type (Li-ion, Lead Acid, Gel/Dry Cell, etc).
9.  Power Supply of 230V, 50Hz AC will be provided.
10. Robots must be insulated for particular hurdles.
11. Lego Kits or Readymade Toys are not allowed.

ARENA SPECIFICATIONS

1.  The competiton field consists of 16*16 SqF. The walls of the Maze are 10 CM High and 2 CM Thick
2.  (Assume 5% Tolerance for Mazes). The Maze comprises up to 14*14 SqF, for a total Maze size of up
3.  to 196 SqF (Assume 5-7% Tolerance for Mazes). The outside wall encloses the entire Maze.
4.  The sides of the Maze Walls are white, the tops of the walls are red, and the floor is black. The maze
5.  is made of wood, finished with non – gloss paint.
6.  WARNING : Do not assume the walls are consistently white, or that the tops of the walls are
7.  consistently red, or that the floor is consistently black. Fading may occur; Parts from different mazes
8.  may be used. Do not assume the floor provides a given amount of friction. It is simply painted
9.  plywood and may be quite slick.
10. The Maze floor may be constructed using multiple sheets of plywood. Therefore, there may be a
11. seam between the two sheets on which any low hanging parts of a mouse may snag
12. The start of the Maze is located at one of the four corners. The start square is bounded on three
13. sides by walls.
14. The start line is located between the first and second squares. That is, as the mouse exits the corner square, the time starts. The destination goal is the four cells at the center of the maze.
15. Small square zones (posts), each 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm, at the four corners of each unit square are called
16. lattice points. The maze is so constituted that there is at least one wall at each lattice point.
17. Multiple paths to the destination square are allowed and are to be expected. The destination square
18. will be positioned so that a wall hugging mouse will NOT be able to find it.
19. Small changes will be made in final Arena.
